# Retail-data-Pipeline
Build an end-to-end data pipeline to collect, process, analyze, and visualize retail sales data.
The pipeline extracts data from CSV files, uploads it to Google Cloud Storage, loads it into BigQuery for analysis, created a dashboard of visual data from the analysis (such as pie charts that represent popular products sold etc.), and performs data quality checks using Soda and transformations using dbt (Data Build Tool).
This project leverages modern data engineering tools and cloud services to create a scalable and efficient data pipeline for retail data. The pipeline ensures data is uploaded, validated, transformed, and ready for BigQuery analysis.
